# Getting Started with Create React App


Old Github progress: https://github.com/Ccolina03/carlos_colina_launchpad-react-code-challenge


Hello, I am Carlos! You will find the challenge whole code in the Master Branch and I tagged the answer to each of the question in specific branches/commits. The structure of the website is divided in three parts: Home, Postal and Universities. Each one of them represents a page and has their own components, server and store and modal (for question 2). The application itself works properly in localhost3000, but has one specific error when deployed in Github Pages (specifically in the Universities dropdown selection). I will continue to look for ways to improve in the following days or as soon as my 6 finals are over. I had a lot of fun working on this small project, and although I didn't have too much time to properly customize and style it as I wanted, I think I handled it well given the short amount of time I spent on it. I am looking forward to discovering new ways to contribute to your team.
